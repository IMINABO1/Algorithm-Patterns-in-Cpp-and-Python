# Algorithm Patterns in C++

A comprehensive collection of common algorithm patterns implemented in C++, designed to help developers master key algorithmic techniques for coding interviews and competitive programming.

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of popular algorithm patterns that frequently appear in coding interviews and competitive programming. Each pattern includes:

- Detailed problem descriptions
- Step-by-step algorithmic approaches
- Example inputs and outputs
- Clean C++ implementations with helpful comments

## Algorithm Patterns

This repository will cover various algorithm patterns including (but not limited to):

- **Sliding Window**: Efficiently process contiguous sequences
- **Two Pointers**: Solve array problems with less memory complexity
- **Fast & Slow Pointers**: Cycle detection in arrays/linked lists
- **Merge Intervals**: Process overlapping intervals/ranges
- **Cyclic Sort**: Sort arrays with values in a given range
- **In-place Reversal of Linked List**: Reverse linked lists with O(1) space
- **Tree BFS/DFS**: Tree traversal strategies
- **Two Heaps**: Process streams with median, etc.
- **Subsets**: Generate permutations, combinations
- **Modified Binary Search**: Variations of binary search
- **Topological Sort**: Process directed graphs
- **Dynamic Programming**: Solve optimization problems
- **Backtracking**: Generate valid permutations and combinations

Currently implemented patterns:
- Merge Intervals

## How to Use

Each pattern is organized in its own directory with individual C++ files for specific problems:

1. Navigate to the pattern directory you're interested in
2. Start with the introductory file for that pattern (e.g., `intro-pattern-name.cpp`)
3. Read the problem statement and approach explanation at the top of each file
4. Review the implementation and comments for detailed understanding
