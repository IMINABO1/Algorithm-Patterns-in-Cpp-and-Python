# Algorithm Patterns in C++

Just a collection of common algorithm patterns implemented in C++, designed to help quickly review key algorithmic techniques for coding interviews and competitive programming.

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of popular algorithm patterns that frequently appear in coding interviews and competitive programming. Each pattern includes:

- Sufficient problem descriptions
- Step-by-step algorithmic approaches
- Example inputs and outputs
- Clean C++ implementations with helpful comments
- PSA: This is not an introduction to algorithms, it's for people working on spaced repitition, speed, and quick review. HOWEVER, if you're dedicated, you can quickly learn what's needed before fully understanding this, which isn't a lot if you take out the inital fear/hesitation. Try to map out the exact operations on paper to see why the algorithms work in the first place. 

## Algorithm Patterns

This repository will cover various algorithm patterns including (but not limited to):

- **Sliding Window**: Efficiently process contiguous sequences
- **Two Pointers**: Solve array problems with less memory complexity
- **Fast & Slow Pointers**: Cycle detection in arrays/linked lists
- **Merge Intervals**: Process overlapping intervals/ranges
- **Cyclic Sort**: Sort arrays with values in a given range
- **In-place Reversal of Linked List**: Reverse linked lists with O(1) space
- **Tree BFS/DFS**: Tree traversal strategies
- **Two Heaps**: Process streams with median, etc.
- **Subsets**: Generate permutations, combinations
- **Modified Binary Search**: Variations of binary search
- **Topological Sort**: Process directed graphs
- **Dynamic Programming**: Solve optimization problems
- **Backtracking**: Generate valid permutations and combinations

Currently implemented patterns:
- Merge Intervals

## How to Use

Each pattern is organized in its own directory with individual C++ files for specific problems:

1. Navigate to the pattern directory you're interested in
2. Start with the introductory file for that pattern (e.g., `intro-pattern-name.cpp`)
3. Read the problem statement and approach explanation at the top of each file
4. Review the implementation and comments for detailed understanding
